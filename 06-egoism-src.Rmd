### *The Ring of Gyges*

--

.example[

Gyges was a shepherd who found a golden ring in a cave, which made him invisible when he wore it. So he seduced the queen, killed the king and lived happily ever after.
]

.note[
From an Ancient Persian tale retold by Plato in *The Republic*.

<br>

- If you had such power, would you be able to resist the temptation to act on your selfish desires?

--

- Are people inherently selfish and only kept in check by fear of getting caught?

---
### *The philosophy of selfishness*

--

.topcap[
psychological egoism
]

.argument[

We *cannot* be unselfish, so we should forget about even trying to be ethical.

]

--

.topcap[
ethical egoism
]

.argument[

We *should not* be unselfish since there are good reasons to always put yourself first.

]

--

.note[

<br>

These are related but different ways of pointing out the limitations of ethics, as either *unrealistic* or *counter-productive.*

---
### *Psychological Egoism*

![:scale 50%, #222;](img/06/jinkyr-grafitti-1.jpg)

--

- A purely *descriptive* theory about the nature of human motivation.

--

- Claims that ethics is *impossible* since there are is such thing as "selfless good deeds."

--

- Presents itself as a realistic alternative to sentimental idealism about human beings.

---
### *Deflating altruism*

--

Psychological Egoism (PE) claims that all claims about selfless good deeds are exagerrated since we *always* have hidden selfish motives.

--

one example:

]

.argument[

So what if somebody gives their money to charity?

They are probably just doing it to make themselves feel better.

]

--

- How is this not just a cynical dismissal of generosity and a theory to be taken seriously?

--

- Let's consider the arguments...

### *Is PE true?*

---

--

.topcap[

my choices are for me

]

--

.argument[

If I freely decide to do something it must be for my own reasons, otherwise I couldn't act.

This means all decisions of mine have motives.

***

So PE is true, everything I do deliberately is selfish.

]

--

- This seems like common sense psychology.

--

- But perhaps there is a subtle shift of meaning here: does it follow that all motives are *for my sake alone* just because they are *my motives*?

---

--

.topcap[

appealing to hidden motives

]

--

.argument[

If PE is true, it should be possible to find a hidden motive behind all apparently altruistic acts.

We can find a hidden motive behind all apparently altruistic acts.

***

So PE is true.

]

--

- Good theories need evidence to back them up.

--

- PE has *unlimited evidence* to back it up, since *any* action that seems altruistic can be dismissed as the result of hidden selfish motives, so it's a great theory, right?

### *Theories, evidence and testing*

---

--

- A theory is an attempt to explain something, but there are always many possible explanations for anything so how can we pick the best?

--

.topcap[
Appealing to evidence in favor of your theory won't work.
]

--

.example[

If autism is caused by vaccinations, then many people who were vaccinated will have autism.

Many vaccinated people do have autism.

***

Thus vaccination causes autism.

]

--

- The problem here is a logical problem: this argument is .red[INVALID].


---

- A theory is an attempt to explain something, but there are always many possible explanations for anything so how can we pick the best?

--

.topcap[
A better approach is to test your claims.
]

--

.example[

If autism is caused by vaccinations, then people who were not vaccinated would have autism at lower rates.

But autism rates are the same among people who were vaccinated and those who were not.

***

Thus vaccination does not cause autism.

]

--

- This argument is .red[INVALID], and shows our explanation to be a bad explanation.

---

- The best explanations are one that *can* be tested and that have not yet failed. 

--

- They is *falsifiable* but not *falsified.*

--

- The problem with Psychological Egoism is that it is *non-falsifiable*.

--

- No matter what examples of unselfish activity we give to a backer of this theory they always have a response, so there is no possible test that the theory can fail.

### *Ethical Egoism*

![:scale 50%, #222;](img/06/jinkyr-grafitti-2.jpg)

--

- A *normative* theory about what we should and shouldn't do.

--

- Claims that ethics is *self-defeating* since acting for the sake of others ultimately leads to a worse outcome, for *all of us.*

--

- Often used in political and economic arguments about capitalism and socialism.
