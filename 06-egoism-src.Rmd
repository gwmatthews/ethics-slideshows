### *Two Varieties of Egoism*

--

.topcap[
psychological egoism
]

.argument[

We *cannot* be unselfish, so we should forget about even trying to be ethical.

]

--

.topcap[
ethical egoism
]

.argument[

We *should not* be unselfish since there are good reasons to always put yourself first.

]

--

.note[

These are related but different ways of pointing out the limitations of ethics, as either *unrealistic* or *counter-productive.*

### *Psychological Egoism*

![:scale 50%, #222;](img/06/jinkyr-grafitti-1.jpg)

--

- A purely *descriptive* theory about the nature of human motivation.

--

- Claims that ethics is *impossible* since there are is such thing as "selfless good deeds."

--

- Presents itself as a realistic alternative to sentimental idealism about human beings.

---
### *Deflating altruism*

--

Psychological Egoism (PE) claims that all claims about selfless good deeds are exagerrated since we *always* have hidden selfish motives.

one example:

.argument[

So what if somebody gives their money to charity?

They are probably just doing it to make themselves feel better.

]

--

- How is this not just a cynical dismissal of generosity and a theory to be taken seriously?

--

- Let's consider the arguments...

### *Is PE true?*

---

--

.topcap[

my choices are for me

]

--

.argument[

If I freely decide to do something it must be for my own reasons, otherwise I couldn't act.

This means all decisions of mine have motives.

***

So PE is true, everything I do deliberately is selfish.

]

--

- This seems like common sense psychology.

--

- But perhaps there is a subtle shift of meaning here: does it follow that all motives are *for my sake alone* just because they are *mine?*

---

--

.topcap[

appealing to hidden motives

]

--

.argument[

In arguing against PE people often come up with counterexamples: cases of apparent altruism.

And yet all of these can be explained away as the result of hidden selfish motives.

***

So psychological egoism is true.

]

--

- Good theories need evidence to back them up.

--

- PE has *unlimited evidence* to back it up, since *any* action that seems altruistic can be dismissed as the result of hidden selfish motives, so it's a great theory, right?
