### the case of the runaway trolley

.dark-gray-box[

- You are standing near a switch next a railroad track when you notice a runaway trolley coming down the tracks in your direction.

- There are five children playing on the track below too far away to hear you.

- There is one worker on the other track where the traincar would go if you threw the switch.
]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

- *Would* you throw the switch?

--

- *Should* you throw the switch?

--

- **WHY?**

### descriptive ethics

--

- How do people actually respond to ethical dilemmas?

--

- What psychological and sociological explanations account for our ethical thinking and behavior?

--

- How might ethical thinking and bahavior vary with circumstances, upbringing, culture or education?

--

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

.light-gray-box[

- Cases like the runaway trolley have been studied extensively by moral psychologists.
 
- **One result**: most people say they would throw the switch.

class: inverse

### prescriptive ethics

--

- How *should* we respond to ethical dilemmas and problems?

--

- What justifications are there for our moral claims and assumptions?

--

- How can we use critical rationality to establish ethical norms?

--

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

.light-gray-box[
- Many of us assume that the consequences of our actions determine their rightness or wrongness.
 
- Is this a correct assumption? Do better consequences *really* make an act morally right?

### another runaway trolley

.dark-gray-box[

- You are standing on a bridge over a railroad track railroad when you notice a runaway trolley coming down the tracks in your direction.

- There are five children playing on the track below too far away to hear you.

- There is a rather large person next to you and if you push him in front of the trolley it will stop the trolley but kill him.
]

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

--

- Most people would **not** push the person off the bridge to save the children.

--

- Why not, given that the consequences are the same in this case and the last?



---
class: inverse

### meta-ethics

--

- How do ethical language and thinking differ frome other ways of speaking or thinking?

--

- Are ethical claims about the facts, are they opinions or are they something else entirely?

--

- Is there any hope for rationally settling conflicts in ethics?

--

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

.light-gray-box[

- When we claim that it is acceptable to throw the switch, but not to push the person off of the bridge are we making a statement about a fact?
 
- Or are we merely expressing an opinion?

- Or are we doing something else and *what exactly might that be?*

### elements of philosophical ethics
---

.dark-gray-box[1. .red[Appeal to reason]

2. Attempt at universality

3. Commitment to impartiality

4. Insistence on overriding character of ethical principles]



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Philosophers trust reason as a method of discovering truth and producing genuine conviction.

---

.dark-gray-box[1. Appeal to reason

2. .red[Attempt at universality]

3. Commitment to impartiality

4. Insistence on overriding character of ethical principles]



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Ethics aspires to find principles that transcend individual cases and apply to all relevantly similar situations.

---

.dark-gray-box[1. Appeal to reason

2. Attempt at universality

3. .red[Commitment to impartiality]

4. Insistence on overriding character of ethical principles]



&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Right and wrong shouldn't depend on who you are.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

If ethics is about what is fundamentally right and wrong it overrides preference, customs and convenience.

### our plan of attack

---
.left-column[

### .red[logic]

]

.right-column[

Before anything else we need to know something about toolkit used by philosophers -- the critical assessment of arguments and the ways in which we often get things wrong in reasoning.

.left-column[

### .gray[logic]

### .red[ethical theory]

.right-column[

Next we consider various approaches to spelling out the nature of ethics. This will involve examining the relationship between ethics, culture, religion, self-interest as well as the possibility of basing ethical norms on our capacity to think for ourselves.

.left-column[

### .gray[logic]

### .gray[ethical theory]

### .red[applied ethics]

.right-column[

Finally we see how all of this plays out in the real world. Here we will examine many particular cases where values are at stake.
