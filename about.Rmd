These slideshows are intended as tutorials on the basic concepts of philosophical ethics. I use them in online courses as a supplement to readings and discussions. Don't worry I would never subject students in a classroom to such detailed notes! Talk about death by powerpoint. I built them since the old pdf slideshows I used to use were in need of revision and since they were not accessible to people using screen readers and other such tools. These display as html and so should be accessible to all.

They are written in Rmarkdown and built into a static website using Rstudio IDE and the xaringan slides package developed by Yi Hui. You are welcome to grab the source code and use it for your own purposes, since they are licensed under the Creative Commons SA-BY 4.0 license, which means you can remix and use as long as you share your work and give me some credit. 

Due to limitations of the xaringan slides package they are not compiled as standalone html files but as markdown files that are rendered on the fly into html in your browser by the javascript programs in the site_libs folder. If that's all gibberish to you, you can use them or view them as long as you are online and have a link to the slideshow.

Here's the [githib repository](https://github.com/gwmatthews/ethics-slideshows) where the code lives.
