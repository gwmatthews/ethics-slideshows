### *Common assumptions*

---

![:scale 50%, #222;  alt="photo"](img/05/peter-h-2.jpg)

&lt;br&gt;

--

.argument[

Moral rules are taught by adults to children, often in religious contexts.

]

---

![:scale 50%, #222;  alt="photo"](img/05/peter-h-4.jpg)

&lt;br&gt; 

.argument[

Without this kind of moral training children end up not having a solid sense of right and wrong.

]

&lt;br&gt;


.argument[

Religion *in fact* has historically provided a normative framework for social life -- religion is the source of social and ethical rules.

]



---
layout: true

### *How to base ethics on religion*

---

--

From these assumptions it seems to follow that morality can and should  be based on religious teachings. 

--

The two chief ways of attempting to do this are:

--

.topcap[Divine Command Theory]

.argument[

Appeals to *divine authority* as the basis of ethical rules.

"God creates the rules and we all have to follow those rules or else."

]

---

From these assumptions it seems to follow that morality *can and should  be* based on religious teachings. 

The two chief ways of attempting to do this are:

.topcap[Natural Law Theory]

.argument[

Appeals to a religiously based conception of *human nature* as the basis of ethics.

"God created us with a built-in purpose and the ability to see for ourselves what that purpose requires us to do."

]

---
layout: false

### *Divine Command Theory*

--

- DCT is a theory of the meaning of moral language.

--

- Morality takes the form of overriding and absolute commands: "Thou shalt not, do this that or the other thing."

--

- Such commands are binding on us only to the extent that there is a sufficiently powerful moral authority behind them, otherwise they would be optional.

--

.topcap[for example:]

.argument[

"Murder is wrong," really means "God commands us not to murder each other."

]

---
### *If DCT is true...*

--

- Morality would have an objective basis and we would have a strong reason to follow the rules.

--

- We could avoid the trap of relativism.

--

.topcap[But...]

--

- We would have to settle religious questions before we could settle moral ones -- what *exactly* does God command?

--

- Non-religious people can't really have morality -- for them nothing would be ultimately forbidden.


---
layout: true
### *Is DCT true?*

---

--

.topcap[A theological argument]

.argument[

If God created everything, this certainly must include the rules of morality.

God created everything.

***

Thus God must have created the rules of morality.
]

--

- A valid argument, but are the premises are really true? 

--

- We'll see a reason to doubt the truth of the first in a moment...

---

.topcap[The argument from moral facts]

.argument[

If God didn't exist, there would be nothing that is just plain wrong .

But some things are in fact just plain wrong.

***

Thus Divine Command Theory is true -- God exists and is the basis of morality.
]

--

- This argument is sometimes used to prove that there must be a God. 

--

- But doesn't it beg the question by assuming that the existence of God is *required* for morality?

---
layout: true

### The Dilemma of DCT

---

--

Even if these arguments worked DCT would face a dilemma in trying to account for *why* we should listen to God's commands.

&lt;br&gt;

--

.argument[

Is it because God commands us to do something that makes it the right thing to do?

Or is it the fact that it is right that leads God to command us to do it?

]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.center[Let's consider these one at a time, to see why neither works.]

---

&lt;br&gt;

.argument[

Are murder, stealing, lying, etc. wrong **_because_** God says so?

]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.narrow-text[
- But then God *could have said otherwise* and that makes these rules arbitrary.]

--

.narrow-text[ 
- Instead there must be a *reason* why God made the laws He, She or It made...
]

---

&lt;br&gt;

.argument[

Does God command us not to murder, steal, lie, etc. **_because_** those things are wrong?

]

--

&lt;br&gt;

.narrow-text[
- But then moral rules would be *independent of God* and that makes God's commands irrelevant.]

--

.narrow-text[ 
- If the rules themselves have *reasons* God is no longer a foundation of morality, but at best a messenger.
]

--

.narrow-text[ 
- What then might be the source of moral rules? That question remains unanswered.
]

---
layout: false

### Natural Law Theory

--

- Religion not only offers and account of the orgins of human laws, but of the natural order of things in general.

--

- Perhaps *this* could provide a basis for ethics and explain *why* God might command or forbid particular behavior.

--

.topcap[for example:]

.argument[

Murder is wrong because it violates one of the fundamental tendencies of all living things which is to preserve life itself.

]
