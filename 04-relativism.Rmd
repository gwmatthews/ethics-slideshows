- The big question is whether statements about values are just a matter of opinion.

--

- If they are, there would be little point to ethical debate and discussion.

--

- If they are not, and they are not statements of fact what *are* they?

According to relativism...

]

--

- Value judgments are personal, rooted in our sense of identity.

--

- They are absorbed from our cultural environment.

--

- Like cultural norms regarding food, manners and personal affairs they are not subject to critical evaluation.

Every theory we will look at:

--

- Makes certain .purple[assumptions]: we have to start *somewhere*.

--

- Has .purple[implications]: *if it is true*, then we have to accept other stuff too.

--

- Requires support in an .purple[argument]: none are *obvious* even if they might seem believable at first glance.
