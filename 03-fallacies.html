#### How logical are we really?

We are all capable of listening to reason but...

- We get fooled by fallacies.

- Our thinking gets short-circuited by biases.

### *types of fallacies*

---

#### .purple[Fallacies of relevance]

--

- Rely on irrelevant information to push the argument along.

---

#### Fallacies of relevance

- Rely on irrelevant information to push the argument along.

#### .purple[Fallacies of ambiguity]

--

- Depend on multiple meanings of key terms to fool us.

---

#### Fallacies of relevance

- Depend on multiple meanings of key terms to fool us.

#### .purple[Fallacies of presumption]

--

- Rely on hidden assumptions to establish their conclusions.

#### .purple[fallacies of relevance]

### .center[*appeal to authority*]

.right-column[
.example[

Stephanie is a scientist and she says that vaccines cause autism.

***

Thus vaccines are not as safe as the doctors are telling us.

]
]

--

.space[.]

While we often have no choice but to rely on experts, simply appealing to their expertise is never a good idea. 

--

Instead we should actually see what their claims are based on, otherwise we still have no real reason to believe what they tell us. 

---

### .center[*ad hominem*]

.right-column[
.example[

My trainer has me on a strict diet and syas that my health will be better if I lose some wait.

***

But I saw him binge eating ice cream the other day, so I guess his advice is worthless.

]
]

--

.space[.]

Here we are attacking what is said based on who is saying it by pointing out their failure to "practice what they preach."

--

But that isn't relevant since the same argument might be given by anyone else.

---

### .center[*popular appeal*]

.right-column[
.example[

Segregation laws were once popular in the American south, they were democratically enacted.

***

Therefore segregation was acceptable.

]
]

--

.space[.]

There are limitations on the principle of "the majority rules" and these are known as rights.

--

In committing this fallacy we overlook the fact that sometimes a majority of people might just be wrong and that asking for opinions about something is not always the best way to find out the truth about it.

---

### .center[*appeal to force*]

.right-column[
.example[

Matthews, either I pass this class or you might end up having a "accident."

***

Ha! I knew you would realize my work was better than you first said it was.

]
]

--

.space[.]

Threats might be effective as a way of getting people to so what you want, but they can't really provide us with any reasons for belief, can they?

--

At best they provide incentives, but never *reasons* in support.

---

### .center[*appeal to consequences*]

.right-column[
.example[

If evolution is correct then we are all related to all other organisms on the planet.

I refuse to admit that I am related to cockroaches in any way.

***

Therefore evolution must be wrong.

]
]

--

.space[.]

While we may not *like* the consequences of a theory, if the evidence really supports it, we'll just have to get used to them.

---

### .center[*naturalistic fallacy*]

.right-column[
.example[

Women should not be allowed into combat positions in the military, since, after all, women are not as agressive as men are.

]
]

--

.space[.]

There are a couple of problems with this argument, first that it judges individuals in terms of generalizations about the group they belong to. Not all men and women fit the general pattern.

--

Second it ignores the distinction between the way things are *by nature* and what we decide based on such concepts as rights and duties.

---

### .center[*red herring*]

.right-column[
.example[

Why do you keep saying that I am guilty of comitting a crime, when there are important business decisions that need to be made in running this company?

]
]

--

.space[.]

This is less of a formal argument style and more of a debating tactic. 

--

Diverting attention from the topic at hand doesn't settle it one way or the other.

---

### .center[*weak analogy*]

.right-column[
.example[

I oppose taxation because it involves taking money from me unwillingly and that is the same thing as theft!

]
]

--

.space[.]

Analogies can help us illuminate obscure or abstract concepts, but they can also mislead us since they only go so far.

--

We may wonder in this case about any relevant differences.
