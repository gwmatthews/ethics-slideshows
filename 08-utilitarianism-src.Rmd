### *Utilitarianism*

.argument[

The point of morality is to make the world a better place.

Happiness is the highest good, the ultimate aim of all human activity.

***

So an action is right to the extent that it promotes greater happiness and wrong if it leads to greater unhappiness.

]

![:vspace 30]

- Utilitarianism offers itself as a common sense solution to the problem of finding moral common ground.

--

- We need not worry about the fact that we disagree on the *content* of a good life, since we all can agree that *whatever* it is that we are after in life, more satisfaction of our goals is always preferable to less.

]

### *Mill's preference utilitarianism*

.left-column[

![:vspace 100]

![:portrait John Stuart Mill, 1806-1873, 80%](img/08/mill.jpg)

]
---

--

.right-list[

.red[

"It is better to be a human dissatisfied than a pig satisfied, better to be a Socrates satisfied than a fool satisfied."

]

]

--

.right-list[

- Mill was an economist who advocated liberty for all -- men and women.

]

--

.right-list[

- For him some desires are more inherently worthy of satisfaction than others so he rejected Bentham's simple hedonism.

]

--

.right-list[

- He tried to show how all moral rules could be explained as the attempt to help as many individuals satisfy as many of their preferences as possible.

]

### *Rational Choice*

.argument[

1. Figure out what you want and rank it.
2. Estimate the likelihood that different courses of action will satisfy your wants.
3. The rational choice is the choice that brings you the most benefits for the least costs.

]

--

- Everything we do has costs -- time, effort, money, opportunity costs, etc. 

--

- The rational choice in any situation is the one with the best payoff -- the most favorable balance of benefits minus costs.

--

- Utilitarianism endorses this cost/benefit analysis model of rational choice as the basis of morality.

Mill's argument

]

--

.argument[

Rational maximizers of self-interest seek the best possible outcome.

The more people who benefit from my actions the better the outcome.

***

So we should always strive to get the best outcome from the most people.
