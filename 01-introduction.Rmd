### the case of the runaway traincar

.dark-gray-box[

- You are standing near a switch next a railroad track when you notice a runaway traincar coming down the tracks in your direction.

- There are five children playing on the track below too far away to hear you.

- There is one worker on the other track where the traincar would go if you threw the switch.
]

<br><br>

--

- *Would* you throw the switch?

--

- *Should* you throw the switch?

--

- **WHY?**

### descriptive ethics

--

- How do people actually respond to ethical dilemmas?

--

- What psychological and sociological explanations account for our ethical thinking and behavior?

--

- How might ethical thinking and bahavior vary with circumstances, upbringing, culture or education?

--

<br><br>

.light-gray-box[

- Cases like the runaway traincar have been studied extensively by moral psychologists.
 
- **One Result**: most people say they would throw the switch.

### prescriptive ethics

--

- How *should* we respond to ethical dilemmas and problems?

--

- What justifications are there for our moral claims and assumptions?

--

- How can we use critical rationality to establish ethical norms?

--

<br><br>

.light-gray-box[
- Many of us assume that the consequences of our actions determine their rightness or wrongness.
 
- Is this a correct assumption? Do better consequences *really* make an act morally right?

### another runaway traincar

.dark-gray-box[

- You are standing on a bridge over a railroad track railroad when you notice a runaway traincar coming down the tracks in your direction.

- There are five children playing on the track below too far away to hear you.

- There is a rather large person next to you and if you push him in front of the traincar it will stop the traincar but kill him.
]



--


.light-gray-box[
- Most people would **not** push the person off the bridge to save the children.

- Why not, given that the consequences are the same in this case and the last?

### meta-ethics

--

- How do ethical language and thinking differ frome other ways of speaking or thinking?

--

- Are ethical claims about the facts, are they opinions or are they something else entirely?

--

- Is there any hope for rationally settling conflicts in ethics?

--

<br><br>

.light-gray-box[

- When we claim that it is acceptable to throw the switch, but not to push the person off of the bridge are we making a statement about a fact?
 
- Or are we merely expressing an opinion?

- Or are we doing something else and *what exactly might that be?*

If ethics is about what is fundamentally right and wrong it overrides preference, customs and convenience.

### our plan of attack

*First* we look at logic to see what is invoved in justifying any claims that we might make.

*Second* we consider some commonly held beleifs about why ethics cannot really be based on reasoning.

*Third* we look at how we might rationally reconstruct ethical norms.

*Finally* we consider what this all might mean for real life ethical dilemmas.
