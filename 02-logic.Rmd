.example[

- How can we know anything at all? This ancient philosophical question has troubled many people.

- First, note that knowledge is a state of mind, a type of *belief.* But there's more to knowledge than belief.

.left-column[

#### Knowledge:

#### .darkgray[justified,]

#### .red[true,]

#### .gray[belief.]

.right-column[

.example[

- To count as knowledge our beliefs have to be *true.* 

- While it may be hard to figure out just what the facts are, simply believing something strongly is not enough to make it true. 

]]

.left-column[

#### Knowledge:

#### .red[justified,]

#### .gray[true,]

#### .gray[belief.]

.right-column[

.example[

- Finally we need justification for anything to really count as knowledge since knowledge is more than just lucky guessing. 

- How we can justify our claims is one of the concerns of logic.

### .center[*reasoning & logic*]

.pull-left[

#### deduction

- Deductive logic is the logic of *proof*. 

- It shows what else can we figure out based on what we already know.

- Deductive reasoning demonstrates the necessary consequences of given information.

.pull-right[

![:scale 90%, #222](img/sudoku.jpg)

.note[Sudoku puzzles are pure deduction, no guesswork is required.]

]
---

.pull-left[

#### induction

- Inductive logic is the logic of *data analysis*. 

- It shows what is likely to be true given the data that we have.

- In spite of inductive reasoning being weaker than proof we rely on this kind of reasoning every day.

.pull-right[

![:scale 90%, #222](img/sea-level.png)

.note[Probability theory and statistics enable us to make reliable guesses with incomplete information.]

]

---

.pull-left[

#### abduction

- Abductive reasoning is reasoning about the *best explanation* for something.

- It (tries to) show why some way of explaining the facts is better than other ways.

- One explanation is typically better than another when it is simpler and has more predictive power.

### *basic concepts*

.argument[
All humans are mortal.

Socrates is human.

***

Thus Socrates is mortal.
]

---

--

This simple argument has two premises and a conclusion.

--

.double[The premises are the information we start out with and the conclusion is what we claim *logically follows from* that information.]

---

We'd like to know two things about it:

--

1. Is it .red[VALID]?

--

   - That is, does the reasoning work?

--

2. And if so is it .red[SOUND]?

--

   - Is the information in the premises true?

--

.note[*note:* I'll write technical terms in all capitals -- it's not shouting, just a reminder that we are using these words in particular ways. See [glossary](#glossary) for details.]
---

So is this argument VALID?

--

- To check we *assume* that the premises are **TRUE** (don't worry we'll get rid of that assumption later).

--

- Is it possible for the premises to be **TRUE** and the conclusion **FALSE**?

--

- If not, then the argument is .red[VALID], as this one clearly is.

--

.note[This may seem backwards and upsidedown, so read it again!]

---

So then, if is it VALID we then want to know whether it is SOUND.

--

- Since a SOUND argument is a VALID one with true premises, we now get rid of our original assumption and check to see if they are true.

--

- In this case they are -- All humans *are* mortal, and Socrates was one.

--

- The nice thing about sound arguments is that their .red[conclusions are really true]!

--

.note[The not so nice thing is that they are hard to come by for things we'd like to know about.]

### *more examples*

---

.argument[
All cats are animals.

My brother is an animal.

***

Thus my brother is a cat.
]

--

Once again we start with an *assumption* -- let's suppose that the premises are TRUE.

--

- Does the conclusion **have to be true** as well?

--

- Clearly not, just ask him.

--

 - The premises here refer to three *different* categories: animals and two subcategories of animals, which are related in some way, but not in the way the conclusion states.
 
--

Since this argument is INVALID it is thus also UNSOUND.

---

.argument[
All cats are fish.

All fish are made of wood.

***

Thus all cats are made of wood.
]

--

If the premises *were* true would the conclusion *have to be true* as well?

--

- Yes, so it is .red[VALID].

- If cats were part of the larger class "fish" and fish were themselves part of a larger class "things made of wood" then cats would have to be made of wood. (This is a mini PROOF of validity, more on that later.)
 
--

.note[The point here is important sometimes the problem with an argument is even if it is VALID, one or more premises are false. There is more than one way for an argument to fail.]

class: inverse
name: glossary

### *glossary*

- **Argument**: a series of statements in which the premises are intended to logically support the conclusion.

- **Valid**: an argument is valid when it is impossible for the presmises to be true and the conclusion false.

- **Sound**: an argument is sound when it is valid and has true premises.

- **True**: said only of statements, not of arguments, and suprisingly hard to define.

- **False**: the opposite of true and once again said only of individual statements, not arguments.

- **Proof**: a step by step demonstration of the validity of an argument. In a proof we spell out exactly how we can derive the conclusion from nothing but the information contained in the premises.

- **Counterexample**: a possible case in which the presmise of an argument are true and the conclusion is false -- used to show that an argument is invalid.
