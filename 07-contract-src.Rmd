### *The ties that bind*

--

- Our social lives depend on our willingness to cooperate -- to sometimes set aside our own interests for the sake of others.

--

- *Trust* is central to cooperation -- my willingness depends on your willingness and my trust that you will follow through.

--

.topcap[

Our next question:

]

--

.argument[

Is there a *rational basis* for trust, or must trust be based on something besides reason, like feelings of sympathy, shared history, or emotional identification?

Liberal values: emphasis on progress and change.

Most real societies are somewhere in the middle of these two, with some traditional and some modern institutions, aspects and values.

Thomas Hobbes was the founder of modern political philosophy.

]

--

.right-column[

In his 1651 book *Leviathan* he asks:

]

--

.right-column[
.narrow-text[

Assuming that there is no religion, no tradition and no stable set of social laws, how and why would a collection of individuals form a society, establish the rule of law and what would this society look like?

]
]

---

.right-column[

If there were no established laws and social rules, and we all lived in what Hobbes calls "The State of Nature," we would all be free to do as we please.

]

--

.right-column[

But, since there were no laws life would be a state of the "war of all against all," and there would be:

]

--

.right-column[
.narrow-text[

*"No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."*

]
]

---

.right-column[

Thus it only makes sense that individuals in the state of nature would agree to establish rules limiting individual liberty in exchange for the security of the rule of law.

]

--

.right-column[

They would create an "artificial person" of a "commonwealth" and give it power to write and enforce laws regulating social interaction.

]

--

.right-column[

The rules of the social game are thus established and we would be fools not to enter into such a Social Contract.

### *An argument for Social Contract Theory*

--

Hobbes' reflections suggest an argument for moral rules.

--

.topcap[

Morals by agreement

]

--

.argument[

A world in which there were no rules regulating our behavior would be unbearable.

Thus we all have an interest in establishing and abiding by basic rules against lying, stealing, murder, not keep promises, etc.

***

Thus we create and follow such rules.

]

---

.right-column[

What about trust?

]

--

.right-column[

Hobbes thinks we can't trust each other in the state of nature and so have to set up formal rules of social life in the Social Contract.

]

--

.right-column[

It is only by giving up liberty to an *absolute monarch* that we can solve the problem of not being able to trust each other -- under the Social Contract we have no choice but to follow the rules.

]

--

.right-column[

Yet why should we *trust the monarch* him or herself to follow the rules?
