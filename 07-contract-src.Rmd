### *The ties that bind*

- Our social lives depend on our willingness to cooperate -- to sometimes set aside our own interests for the sake of others.

- *Trust* is central to cooperation -- my willingness depends on your willingness and my trust that you will follow through.

Most real societies are somewhere in the middle of these two, with some traditional and some modern institutions, aspects and values.

Thomas Hobbes was the founder of modern political philosophy.

]

--

.right-column[

In his 1651 book Leviathan he asks:

- Assuming that there is no religion, no tradition and no stable set of social laws, how and why would a collection of individuals form a society, establish the rule of law and what would this society look like?

]

---

.right-column[

If there were no established laws and social rules, and we all lived in what Hobbes calls "The State of Nature," we would all be free to do as we please.

]

--

.right-column[

But, since there were no laws life would be a state of the "war of all against all," and there would be:

> "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."

]

---

.right-column[

Thus it only makes sense that individuals in the state of nature would agree to establish rules limiting individual liberty in exchange for the security of the rule of law.

]

--

.right-column[

They would create an "artificial person" of a "commonwealth" and give it power to write and enforce laws regulating social interaction.

]

--

.right-column[

The rules of the social game are thus established and we would be fools not to enter into such a Social Contract.
