### *The big question*

- All of the moral theories we have looked at so far have tied morality to *something else* -- culture, God, human nature, personal advantage, the social good, happiness...

- But don't moral demands *override* all of those at times?

- Having a moral conscience means that sometimes we can see that we just should or shouldn't do something **_no matter what_** else is telling the opposite.

.question[

1. What are our moral obligations anyway?
2. Why should we try to live up to their demands?
3. How can we go about doing that?

### *The moral ideal*

.caution[

If this all seems lofty and abstract, it helps to keep in mind that the point of this whole discussion is to defend an ideal we all take for granted.

![:vspace 20]()

- We all owe each other basic respect and should never treat each other as objects to be used for some end.

- All adults are held responsible for their own decisions, since we are free to choose.

- All of us are capable of seeing what the right thing to do is.

- Nobody is inherently better than anyone else.
