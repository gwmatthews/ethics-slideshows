### *Kant's question*

- All of the moral theories we have looked at so far have tied morality to *something else* -- culture, God, human nature, personal advantage, the social good, happiness...

- But don't moral demands *override* all of those at times?

- Having a moral conscience means that sometimes we can see that we just shouldn't do something **_no matter what_** else is telling us that we should.

How can we possibly step back from *all* of our other concerns and act based only on what is right?

Setting aside all thoughts about the real world and real human beings, 


1. What might a .alert[morally perfect world] look like?
2. Why .alert[should we] try to live up to this ideal?
3. How .alert[can we] go about doing that?
4. What would the .alert[content] of morality be?
